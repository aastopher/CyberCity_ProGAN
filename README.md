# ProGAN (Progressive Generative Adversarial Network) Trained on Cyberpunk Cityscapes

The purpose of this project is to expand knowledge of traditional GAN architectures by exploring NVIDIA's Progressive GAN research. [Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2018-04_progressive-growing-gans-improved-quality-stability-and-variation)

## misc. commands
* to generate sample images run `python utils.py sample` by default this will generate 10 images at 32x32.
* sample command can be customized to generate a chosen amount of images at a chosen size `python utils.py sample <num_images> <size_factor>`
* size factors are as follows `0 = 4x4, 1 = 8x8, 2 = 16x16, 3 = 32x32, 4 = 64x64, 5 = 128x128, 6 = 256x256, 7 = 512x512, 8 = 1024x1024`
* **NOTE:** Please clear results folder before pushing changes.
* to start the tensorboard and explore the current models training progress run `tensorboard --logdir logs`
* **WARNING! This will overwrite existing models!** to re-train the model make sure `LOAD_MODEL` in `config.py` is set to `False` then run `python .\train.py`
